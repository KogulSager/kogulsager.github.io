                  Online reservation systems are a convenient alternative, considering how straightforward the process is. Third-party hotel agencies are also an effective method, but the freedom to add custom functionalities are limited, as hotels might have to change the procedures of reservations based on various elements like customer discounts, weather or special location-based seasons. Considering all hotel business aspects, automated reservation and management systems also have positive impacts to conduct more effective business. Once a management system in initialized, it would act as the major storage method, which is an efficient method to access and store data.

Reservations are obtained through third-party online agency websites. The company is unable to provide direct benefits to the customers as they have limited functionalities with online agencies.

                  The company doesn’t have any automated management system or any dedicated online user reservation system. It would be reasonable to build a centralized web application system to meet the multiple requirements for an effective hotel system. The system would consist of an online reservation web application system for customers to book hotel rooms efficiently, as well as a management system with interlinked company database system to manage the company’s employee and customer information.

                  The hotel automated management systems are the basic and day-to-day maintained application to save and retrieve all user information including the company authorities, employees as well as the clients. An automated application would hold all the essential data such as the user personal information and login credentials. For any company requiring a computerized system, a user management system would be the basic requirement. Technically, the application would be the foundation, considering the company depends on the automated systems to take major decisions. Automating the processes of a holding company would directly affect various factors.

                  Considering security, the entire reservation and centralized management system would be secured using a user login page, where all system users would be expected to have a username or email along with a unique password allocated to them as a fundamental security mechanism. Users would be unable to access any system functionality without first creating an account. This approach ensures that only those who are authorized have access to the system's contents. Moreover, the system user roles based on the functional accessed allowed for every user depends on the user type of the hotel in order to avoid risky vulnerabilities to the system security.

                   Considering Don Y.J company’s requirements, “Agile” system development methodology would be an ideal choice. The agile methodology refers a practice that the application should go through continuous revisions within its development and testing stages. This promotes a situation where the system is constantly checked for errors and inconsistencies over every major phase in the development stage. Agile provides reliable assistance among developers and clients to develop and deliver systems in a proper timeline, while having efficient responses for any functional changes or requests. (Hamilton, 2021).

Scrum promotes to divide the project into multiple sections called sprints, and then upgrade these sprint outcomes until the requirements are met (Lutkevich, 2021). Thus, the application can be regularly tested and reworked for better effectiveness as it would be possible to constantly revise the application. This also ensures that the application would include proper user experience and proper user functionalities for efficient usage.

                   Software architectural design patterns are considered as standards or principles implemented by developer to ensure a straightforward and efficient application development procedure. Architectural design patterns are typically a widespread notion within object-oriented based software programmers. Design patterns are mostly implemented to avoid common and recurring issues and bugs during development. A typical design pattern would seem like an unfinished code, but could be used as a universal template to avoid development issues throughout the entire software application project process.

                  In consideration of the current project requirements, the MVC (Model, View, Controller) architectural pattern would be the most suitable architectural design pattern selection, suitable for Don Y.J Holding’s online reservation system and a centralized management system. The MVC design pattern would promote code modularity and maintainability for the development procedure. MVC is considered as a popular and widespread architectural design pattern that could be implemented to a wide range of programming languages as well as related software frameworks.

                  The intended web application would consist multiple types of software components that would be required to connect and execute together. These components would be required to execute a wide range of varying business logics and database connection events. The front-end interface screens for the functionalities of the web application is required to depend on the user permissions and roles. Considering the system database functionalities and application screens, the architecture rationally separates the system source code and functionalities.

                  Programmers would be able to accomplish the application with less difficulties as there is an efficient modularity. Moreover, even multiple developers would have the ability to develop and update components of the system source code simultaneously, which decreases the development period while having a higher team productivity.

                   An effective analysis and evaluation for the project progress of developing an online reservation and centralized management system for Don Y.J Holdings has assisted to understand the proper project flow. The project targets to develop an online hotel reservation system for the company, with a centralized employee/client management system to store/access company data remotely. The management system will also include a business accounts management system, which the company authorities and employees can use to report and manage the company’s business and account records digitally, which can be accessed remotely. This analysis has revealed proper project scopes along with the knowledge of similar projects. The evaluations of the relevant analysis have assisted the project to make sure the process ensures that the company’s relevant requirements are being properly considered for the development of the application.

                  The project procedures should be conducted in a secure and company-authorized manner. It is also essential that the application is included with proper data protection elements, to prevent data loss or theft. The system would also ensure user permissions so that different users can access only the data they are authorized with. Although the scope of the project is currently straightforward, certain approaches could have been directed in consideration of the limited time available for the project. The initial objectives of the project are already taking up a longer time period of the entire project period. A minor scope adjustment of the project would have been to reduce the analysis procedure times in order to allow more time for application development.

                   The final aim of this project is to develop an online reservation and centralized management system with the use of web application technology for Don Y.J Holdings, to solve the problems faced by the company based on information gathering and business management. The holdings company contains of three tourist hotels and two bungalows. Currently, each hotel/bungalow has a separate system to store/access employee/client information. The company requires a dedicated reservation system for users to reserve hotels and bungalows. The outcome of the project would solve all problems faced by the company currently, as well as offer newer business opportunities.

                  The major strength of the current project application is that the approach to solve the company\s problem is straightforward and used efficient techniques for the solving procedure. The application is planned with the thought of directly solving each problem with the company\s current system. This ensures that every development procedure and technology is dedicated to solve the issue entirely. The application also used up-to-date latest software development tools and technologies. This makes the system ready to face any third-party competition that might exist in the relevant business market, once the application is released for customers.
